#### Advent of code solutions

Hi, here are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)

**All the solutions** were done by me personally without using any GPT tools, therefore code is doing the job and not as groomed as it could be. Though, I will be leaving some comments how current solutions could be improved just for curiousity and educaional purposes.

Also Python is not my main language, so if you have some pure code improvements or ways to make stuff easier do not hesitate to open your PRs :) 

For golang version of solutions I recommend checking [my colleague repo](https://github.com/e1esm/AoC-2023-solutions)

Enjoy and Welcome!
